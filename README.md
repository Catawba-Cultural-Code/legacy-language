# Feedback:
- Get permission before recording
- -Recording symbol is permanent

- move new word button on admin to scroll side at top or maybe at the bottom
- progressively introduce required parts of word and submit button

- handle multiple images and multiple recordings and multiple translations and multipl etc

# Before Release 1 1Ô∏è‚É£
1. add 30 more words (currently 112)

# TODOs üìé

1.  Refactor media queries into theme queries
2. Sanitize data so that strings don't begin or end with ' '
3. Search should use query string to make shareable and navigable
   1. Change to routing solution
4.  Refactor React app state to only use the native react Context and State
   2. Only remaining componenet using ATOMS is KeyboardComponent
   3. Refactor keyboard componenet anyways to be responsive
5.  Refactor /styled into isolated Components <https://paddle.com/blog/why-we-created-an-email-system-using-react/>
6.  Add custom image url to edit/new word
7.  Consolidate batch-upload & word-upload...should presuume an Array of length > 0
8.  Stop multiple api calls from react app
9.  Export data as .csv file

### React App File Structure

The `/app/src` folder follows the Folder/File structure used in Sara Vieira's _THE OPINIONATED GUIDE TO REACT_

Example:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Components/
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Button/
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Pages/
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Homepage/
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Screens/
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Hero/
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ useLocalStorage.js
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ date.js
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ icons/
| ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
```

### React File Naming

Every high-level Component or Page gets its own folder with an expressive name and inside that folder there will be in `index.js` file which is the only way that exterior files should be accessing the contents of the folder. Other contents of the folder are flexible.

Example:

```
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Login/
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Buttons/
| |--------index.js
| |--------RegisterButton.js
```

React understands these three import statements the same way, assuming the above file structure:

```javascript
import Login from './Login/index.js'
```

vs

```javascript
import Login from './Login/index'
```

vs

```javascript
import Login from './Login
```

### Styles

Although the app currently uses Material-ui design system/components for quick prototyping, which comes with its own 'styled' functionality, components should be styled using the styled-components pacakge. The syntax is much more intuitive for CSS users than re-learning CSS properties as JS Object properties (which is what Material UI requires).
Examples:

```javascript
// use . syntax for any native HTML elements
const RedCircle = styled.div`
  background-color: red;
  border-radius: 100%;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
`
// Declare styled component outside the body of the react component
const ColorfulComponent = () => {
  // Declare styled components just like you would any other react component
  return <RedCircle />
}
```

styled-components also make it easy to extend styles.
For example (continuing earlier example):

```javascript
// Use ( ) syntax for any non-native html components, such as custom made components and Material UI components
const BlueCircle = styled(RedCircle)`
  background-color: #0000ff;
`

const ColorfulComponents = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <RedCircle />
      <BlueCircle />
    </div>
  )
}
```

styled-components have a lot of other features including SASS style nesting & changing style properties based on props passed to the component. check it out at: (https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#adapting-based-on-props)
