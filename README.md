# Opinions ðŸ‘½
### React App File Structure
The `/app/src` folder follows the Folder/File structure used in Sara Vieira's *THE OPINIONATED GUIDE TO REACT*

Example:
```
â”œâ”€â”€ src
| â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
| â”œâ”€â”€ Components/
| â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€ Button/
| â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ index.js
| â”œâ”€â”€ Pages/
| â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€ Homepage/
| â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€ Screens/
| â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ Hero/
| â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ index.js
| â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€ index.js
| â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
| â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
| â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€ hooks/
| â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ useLocalStorage.js
| â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€ date.js
| â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
| â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€ icons/
| â””â”€â”€â”€â”€ images/
```
### React File Naming
Every high-level Component or Page gets its own folder with an expressive name and inside that folder there will be in `index.js` file which is the only way that exterior files should be accessing the contents of the folder. Other contents of the folder are flexible.

Example:
```
| â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€ Login/
| â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ index.js
| â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ Buttons/
| |--------index.js
| |--------RegisterButton.js
```
React understands these three import statements the same way, assuming the above file structure:
```javascript
import Login from './Login/index.js'
```
vs
```javascript
import Login from './Login/index'
```
vs
```javascript
import Login from './Login
```


# TODOs ðŸ“Ž
1. Refactor React app state to only use the native react Context and State
