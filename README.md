# Feedback:
- Get permission before recording
- -Recording symbol is permanent
- Check that no existing word for language-entry -> different modal screen
- move new word button on admin to scroll side at top or maybe at the bottom
- progressively introduce required parts of word and submit button
- check that the language_entry doesn't already exist
- handle multiple images and multiple recordings and multiple translations and multipl etc

# Before Release 1 1Ô∏è‚É£

# Opinions üëΩ

### React App File Structure

The `/app/src` folder follows the Folder/File structure used in Sara Vieira's _THE OPINIONATED GUIDE TO REACT_

Example:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Components/
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Button/
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Pages/
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Homepage/
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Screens/
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Hero/
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ useLocalStorage.js
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ date.js
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ icons/
| ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
```

### React File Naming

Every high-level Component or Page gets its own folder with an expressive name and inside that folder there will be in `index.js` file which is the only way that exterior files should be accessing the contents of the folder. Other contents of the folder are flexible.

Example:

```
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Login/
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
| ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Buttons/
| |--------index.js
| |--------RegisterButton.js
```

React understands these three import statements the same way, assuming the above file structure:

```javascript
import Login from './Login/index.js'
```

vs

```javascript
import Login from './Login/index'
```

vs

```javascript
import Login from './Login
```

### Styles

Although the app currently uses Material-ui design system/components for quick prototyping, which comes with its own 'styled' functionality, components should be styled using the styled-components pacakge. The syntax is much more intuitive for CSS users than re-learning CSS properties as JS Object properties (which is what Material UI requires).
Examples:

```javascript
// use . syntax for any native HTML elements
const RedCircle = styled.div`
  background-color: red;
  border-radius: 100%;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
`
// Declare styled component outside the body of the react component
const ColorfulComponent = () => {
  // Declare styled components just like you would any other react component
  return <RedCircle />
}
```

styled-components also make it easy to extend styles.
For example (continuing earlier example):

```javascript
// Use ( ) syntax for any non-native html components, such as custom made components and Material UI components
const BlueCircle = styled(RedCircle)`
  background-color: #0000ff;
`

const ColorfulComponents = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <RedCircle />
      <BlueCircle />
    </div>
  )
}
```

styled-components have a lot of other features including SASS style nesting & changing style properties based on props passed to the component. check it out at: (https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#adapting-based-on-props)
