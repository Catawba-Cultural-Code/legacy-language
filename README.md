### React App File Structure

The `/app/src` folder follows the Folder/File structure used in Sara Vieira's _THE OPINIONATED GUIDE TO REACT_

Example:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ src
| â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
| â”œâ”€â”€ Components/
| â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€ Button/
| â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ index.js
| â”œâ”€â”€ Pages/
| â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€ Homepage/
| â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€ Screens/
| â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ Hero/
| â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ index.js
| â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€ index.js
| â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
| â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
| â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€ hooks/
| â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ useLocalStorage.js
| â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€ date.js
| â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
| â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€ icons/
| â””â”€â”€â”€â”€ images/
```

### React File Naming

Every high-level Component or Page gets its own folder with an expressive name and inside that folder there will be in `index.js` file which is the only way that exterior files should be accessing the contents of the folder. Other contents of the folder are flexible.

Example:

```
| â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€ Login/
| â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ index.js
| â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ Buttons/
| |--------index.js
| |--------RegisterButton.js
```

React understands these three import statements the same way, assuming the above file structure:

```javascript
import Login from './Login/index.js'
```

vs

```javascript
import Login from './Login/index'
```

vs

```javascript
import Login from './Login
```

### Styles

Although the app currently uses Material-ui design system/components for quick prototyping, which comes with its own 'styled' functionality, components should be styled using the styled-components pacakge. The syntax is much more intuitive for CSS users than re-learning CSS properties as JS Object properties (which is what Material UI requires).
Examples:

```javascript
// use . syntax for any native HTML elements
const RedCircle = styled.div`
  background-color: red;
  border-radius: 100%;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
`
// Declare styled component outside the body of the react component
const ColorfulComponent = () => {
  // Declare styled components just like you would any other react component
  return <RedCircle />
}
```

styled-components also make it easy to extend styles.
For example (continuing earlier example):

```javascript
// Use ( ) syntax for any non-native html components, such as custom made components and Material UI components
const BlueCircle = styled(RedCircle)`
  background-color: #0000ff;
`

const ColorfulComponents = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <RedCircle />
      <BlueCircle />
    </div>
  )
}
```

styled-components have a lot of other features including SASS style nesting & changing style properties based on props passed to the component. check it out at: (https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#adapting-based-on-props)
